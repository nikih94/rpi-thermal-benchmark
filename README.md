# Raspberry Pi Thermal Benchmark Tool

This Python script is designed to perform a **thermal benchmark on Raspberry Pi** devices using controlled CPU loads via `stress-ng`. It monitors the CPU temperature while alternating between **idle** and **load** periods, and logs the average temperature to a CSV file every minute.

---

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

- Applies increasing CPU loads (e.g., 20%, 40%, ..., 100%) using `stress-ng`
- Each load phase is preceded by an idle (cool down) period
- Records the CPU temperature every 10 seconds
- Logs the **average temperature per minute** to a CSV file (`stats.csv`)
- Designed to test **thermal performance and cooling** of Raspberry Pi devices

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (tested on models with `vcgencmd`)
- Python 3
- `stress-ng` utility

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stress-ng
```

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Clone or copy the script

Save the script as `stressng_temp_benchmark.py`.

### 2. Configure the parameters

At the top of the script, you can configure:

```python
stress_time = 20      # minutes under load
idle_time = 20        # minutes in idle before each load phase
loads = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]  # CPU load percentages
cpu_workers = 4       # Number of CPU stress workers (usually number of cores)
sample_interval = 10  # Temperature sampling interval (in seconds)
```

Adjust `cpu_workers` based on your Pi model (e.g., 4 for Raspberry Pi 4).

### 3. Run the script

```bash
python3 stressng_temp_benchmark.py
```

The script will:
- Idle for `idle_time` minutes (logging temperature)
- Apply each load from the `loads` array for `stress_time` minutes
- Log temperature data to `stats.csv`

## ðŸ“„ Output: `stats.csv`

The output CSV contains:

| timestamp           | load | cpu_temp |
|---------------------|------|----------|
| 2025-05-20 14:00:00 | 0    | 42.5     |
| 2025-05-20 14:01:00 | 0    | 42.6     |
| 2025-05-20 14:20:00 | 20   | 48.3     |
| ...                 | ...  | ...      |

- `timestamp`: Current time (logged once per minute)
- `load`: Load % applied (0 during idle)
- `cpu_temp`: Average CPU temp over the last minute (in Â°C)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

This tool is useful for:

- **Testing thermal throttling behavior**
- Evaluating **cooling performance** of heatsinks, fans, or cases
- Comparing different **Raspberry Pi models** under stress
- Logging temperature for **hardware validation**
